1. Basic HQL Query with Pagination

To implement pagination using Hibernate HQL (Hibernate Query Language), you can use the setFirstResult and setMaxResults methods provided by the Query interface.
These methods allow you to define the starting position and limit the number of records fetched from the database,
which is crucial for paginating large datasets.


Imagine you’re at a huge library filled with thousands of books. You're interested in reading a long, detailed encyclopedia about your favorite topic,
but you don’t want to (or can’t) read the whole thing at once because it's massive and overwhelming. 
Instead, you decide to break it down and read just a few pages at a time.

You go to the librarian, who has a clever system. She knows that each time you come back,
you’ll want to start where you left off. She hands you 10 pages at a time. Once you finish those, you come back, and she gives you the next 10 pages. 
This way, you’re not burdened by carrying or reading the entire book at once, and it’s easier to digest the information bit by bit.
